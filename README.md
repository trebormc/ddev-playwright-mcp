# ddev-playwright-mcp

A DDEV add-on that provides a [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/anthropics/playwright-mcp) server for headless browser automation via the Model Context Protocol. It gives AI agents a real Chromium browser to interact with your Drupal site -- navigate pages, fill forms, take screenshots, and verify UI state programmatically.

> **Note:** This add-on is typically installed automatically as a dependency of [ddev-opencode](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-opencode), [ddev-claude-code](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-claude-code), or [ddev-ralph](https://github.com/trebormc/ddev-ralph). You rarely need to install it directly.

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get trebormc/ddev-playwright-mcp
ddev restart
```

## What It Does

This add-on runs a **Playwright MCP server** as a DDEV service with headless Chromium. It exposes an MCP endpoint at `http://playwright-mcp:8931/mcp` accessible from other containers in the DDEV network.

Use cases:
- **AI-driven development** -- Let AI agents (OpenCode, Claude Code) interact with your site through a real browser
- **Visual testing** -- Take screenshots and verify UI state programmatically
- **Browser automation** -- Automate form submissions, navigation, and interactions

## Usage

### From Other Containers

Connect to the MCP server at:
```
http://playwright-mcp:8931/mcp
```

### Screenshots

Screenshots are saved to the `screenshots/` directory in your project root, accessible from both the container and the host.

### Custom Image Version

To use a specific Playwright MCP image version:

```bash
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.playwright-mcp --playwright-mcp-image=mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp:v1.2.0
ddev restart
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_IMAGE` | `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp:latest` | Docker image to use |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Timezone |

## Tips

- **Use HTTP** (not HTTPS) when navigating to your DDEV site from Playwright to avoid SSL certificate issues in local environments.
- The MCP server runs in **shared browser context** mode -- cookies and sessions persist across requests.
- Screenshots output directory: `/tmp/playwright-output` (mapped to `./screenshots/` on host).

## Uninstallation

```bash
ddev add-on remove ddev-playwright-mcp
ddev restart
```
